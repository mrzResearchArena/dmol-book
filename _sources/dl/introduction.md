Intro to Deep Learning
=======================

**Deep learning** is a category of **machine learning**. Machine learning is a category of **artificial intelligence**. These notes are mostly about deep learning, thus the name of the book. Deep learning is the use of neural networks to classify and regress data. I am a chemical engineering professor though; writing an introduction to deep learning is a hopeless task for me. I found introduction the from [Ian Goodfellow's book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html) to be a good intro. If you're more visually oriented, Grant Sanderson has made a [short video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) specifically about neural networks that give an applied introduction to the topic. DeepMind has a high-level video showing what can be accomplished with [deep learning & AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R52wiUgxZI). When people write "deep learning is really cool" in their research papers, they typically cite [this Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539) by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffery Hinton. The only advice I would give to beginners in deep learning are to focus less on the neurological inspired language (i.e., connections between neurons), and instead view deep learning as a series of linear algebra operations where many of the matrices are adjustable parameters.
